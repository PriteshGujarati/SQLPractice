Problem Statement: Identify the Date When Cumulative Sales Cross 60% of Total Monthly Sales

Given a table `transactions` containing transaction data for a single month, write a SQL query to identify the exact date when the cumulative sales first exceed 60% of the total monthly sales.

Table Structure:
The `transactions` table has the following columns:

transaction_id (SERIAL): Unique ID for each transaction (Primary Key).
order_id (INT): Unique ID for each order.
transaction_date (TIMESTAMP): Date and time when the transaction occurred.
amount (DECIMAL(10, 2)): The monetary amount of the transaction.

Your Task:
Determine the first date when the cumulative sales percentage exceeds 60% of the total sales for the month.

Expected Output:
The output should be a single date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` representing the date when cumulative sales first surpass 60% of the total monthly sales.

Considerations:
- Utilize window functions to calculate running totals and percentages.
- Assume that all transactions occur within a single month.

Follow-up Question:
What if I want to see the same analysis for each month or each quarter instead of just one month?

Hint: Consider partitioning by month or quarter while calculating cumulative percentages.
